    "# Day 1 - Lab 1: AI-Powered Requirements & User Stories (Solution)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Use a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose a vague problem statement into structured features, user personas, and Agile user stories, culminating in a machine-readable JSON artifact.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "This notebook contains the complete solution for Lab 1. It demonstrates how to use an LLM to systematically break down a problem, generate structured requirements, and programmatically validate the output. Each step includes explanations of the code and the reasoning behind the prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For definitions of key terms used in this lab, please refer to the [GLOSSARY.md](../../GLOSSARY.md)."

    "## Step 1: Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** This initial block of code prepares our environment for the lab. It adds the project root to the system path to ensure our `utils.py` helper script can be imported, and then initializes the LLM API client.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Selection:**\n",
    "Our `utils.py` script is configured to work with multiple AI providers. You can change the `model_name` parameter in the `setup_llm_client()` function to any of the models listed in the `RECOMMENDED_MODELS` dictionary in `utils.py`. For example, to use a Hugging Face model, you could change the line to: `client, model_name, api_provider = setup_llm_client(model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Libraries Explained:**\n",
    "- **`os`**, **`sys`**: Standard Python libraries for interacting with the file system and Python's path, ensuring our modules are discoverable.\n",
    "- **`json`**: A standard library for working with JSON data. We use `json.loads` to parse the LLM's text output into a Python dictionary or list, and `json.dumps` to format Python objects into a pretty-printed JSON string for saving.\n",
    "- **`utils`**: Our custom helper script. \n",
    "  - `setup_llm_client()`: Handles reading the `.env` file and initializing the API client.\n",
    "  - `get_completion()`: Simplifies the process of sending a prompt to the LLM and receiving a text response.\n",
    "  - `save_artifact()`: Ensures our project artifacts are stored consistently in the `artifacts` directory.\n",
    "  - `clean_llm_output()`: A new standardized function to remove markdown fences from LLM outputs.\n",
    "  - `prompt_enhancer()`: An advanced meta-prompt system that takes raw user input and optimizes it using prompt engineering best practices, including role assignment, context grounding, and structural organization."

    "### Challenge 1 (Foundational): Brainstorming Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "This first challenge demonstrates the power of prompt enhancement. We start with simple, raw prompts for brainstorming features and identifying user personas. However, instead of using these basic prompts directly, we pass them through our `prompt_enhancer` function, which applies advanced prompt engineering techniques to optimize them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `prompt_enhancer` automatically:\n",
    "- Assigns appropriate expert personas (e.g., \"You are a Senior Product Manager\")\n",
    "- Provides structured context and grounding\n",
    "- Defines clear task instructions with assertive action verbs\n",
    "- Sets explicit output format expectations\n",
    "- Organizes the prompt with clear structural delimiters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Efficiency Features:**\n",
    "- We reuse the existing LLM clients that were already initialized, avoiding duplicate setup\n",
    "- Different models can be used for different tasks (e.g., Gemini for features, DeepSeek for personas)\n",
    "- The personas prompt includes the brainstormed features as context for better coherence\n",
    "\n",
    "This enhancement process transforms simple requests into highly optimized prompts that produce more focused, detailed, and useful outputs. The goal is to generate a broad set of high-quality ideas (features and personas) that will serve as the foundation for the more structured tasks to follow."

    "\n",
    "The prompt is carefully engineered:\n",
    "1.  **Persona:** `You are a Senior Product Manager...` tells the LLM the role it should adopt.\n",
    "2.  **Context:** We provide the previous outputs (`problem_statement`, `brainstormed_features`, `user_personas`) inside `<context>` tags to give the LLM all the necessary information.\n",
    "3.  **Format:** The `OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS` section is extremely explicit. It tells the LLM to *only* output JSON, defines the exact keys for each object, and specifies the format for nested data (like the array of Gherkin strings). This strictness is key to getting reliable, machine-readable output.\n",
    "4.  **Parsing:** The `try...except` block is a crucial step. It attempts to parse the LLM's string output into a Python list of dictionaries. If it succeeds, we know the LLM followed our instructions perfectly. If it fails, we print the raw output to help debug the prompt."

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "This is the final and most critical step. We treat the LLM's output as untrusted input and subject it to programmatic validation. This ensures that the artifact we create is reliable and can be consumed by other automated tools in later stages of the SDLC without causing errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `validate_and_save_stories` function acts as a gatekeeper. It checks for the correct data types (a list of objects) and ensures that all required fields are present in each object. Only if all checks pass do we proceed to save the file using `save_artifact`. This creates a trustworthy `day1_user_stories.json` file that can be confidently used as an input for other automated processes in our SDLC."

This is the critical first step in an AI-assisted software development lifecycle. The `day1_user_stories.json` file you created will be the direct input for our next lab, where we will generate a formal Product Requirements Document (PRD).\n",
