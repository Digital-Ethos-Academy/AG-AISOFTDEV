    "### Challenge 1 (Foundational): Building a LangChain Agent with One Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "LangChain provides a modular and flexible way to build agents. \n",
    "1.  **Tool:** We instantiate `TavilySearchResults`, which is a pre-built LangChain component that knows how to call the Tavily API.\n",
    "2.  **Prompt:** The prompt is crucial. `ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages` creates a template for the conversation. The key part is the `(\"placeholder\", \"{agent_scratchpad}\")`. The `agent_scratchpad` is a special variable where the agent's internal monologue (its thoughts, tool calls, and tool outputs) is stored. This allows the agent to reason about its actions.\n",
    "3.  **Agent:** `create_tool_calling_agent` binds the LLM, the tools, and the prompt together into a runnable agent.\n",
    "4.  **AgentExecutor:** This is the runtime for the agent. It takes the agent and the tools and handles the logic of calling the agent, parsing its output to see if it wants to use a tool, executing the tool, and passing the result back to the agent to continue its reasoning."

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "This challenge demonstrates the core reasoning power of an agent. \n",
    "1.  **`@tool` Decorator:** LangChain provides a simple `@tool` decorator to turn any Python function into a tool that an agent can use. The function's docstring is very important, as the agent uses it to understand what the tool does.\n",
    "2.  **Tool List:** We create a new list containing both our custom `multiply` tool and the pre-built `TavilySearchResults` tool.\n",
    "3.  **Reasoning:** When the agent receives a query, it looks at the user's question and the docstrings of all available tools. It then makes a decision about which tool, if any, is the most appropriate for the task. This ability to choose the right tool for the job is the fundamental capability of an agent. For \"25 * 48\", it will see the \"Multiplies two integers\" docstring and choose the `multiply` tool. For \"Who is the CEO of Apple?\", it will recognize that it needs external information and choose the search tool."
