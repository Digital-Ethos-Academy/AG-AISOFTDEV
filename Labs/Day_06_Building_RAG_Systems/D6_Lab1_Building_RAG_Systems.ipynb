    "# Day 6 - Lab 1: Building RAG Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Build a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system orchestrated by LangGraph, scaling in complexity from a simple retriever to a multi-agent team that includes a grader and a router.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 180 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "Welcome to Day 6! Today, we build one of the most powerful and common patterns for enterprise AI: a system that can answer questions about your private documents. We will use LangGraph to create a 'research team' of AI agents. Each agent will have a specific job, and LangGraph will act as the manager, orchestrating their collaboration to find the best possible answer.\n",

    "## Step 1: Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We need several libraries for this lab. `langgraph` is the core orchestrator, `langchain` provides the building blocks, `faiss-cpu` is for our vector store, and `pypdf` is for loading documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Selection:**\n",
    "For RAG and agentic workflows, models with strong instruction-following and reasoning are best. `gpt-4.1`, `o3`, or `gemini-2.5-pro` are excellent choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Helper Functions Used:**\n",
    "- `setup_llm_client()`: To configure the API client.\n",
    "- `load_artifact()`: To read the project documents that will form our knowledge base."

    "### Challenge 1 (Foundational): A Simple RAG Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Build a simple LangGraph with two nodes: one to retrieve documents and one to generate an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip:** Think of `AgentState` as the shared 'whiteboard' for your agent team. Every agent (or 'node' in the graph) can read from and write to this state, allowing them to pass information to each other as they work on a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  Define the state for your graph using a `TypedDict`. It should contain keys for `question` and `documents`.\n",
    "2.  Create a \"Retriever\" node. This is a Python function that takes the state, uses the `retriever` to get relevant documents, and updates the state with the results.\n",
    "3.  Create a \"Generator\" node. This function takes the state, creates a prompt with the question and retrieved documents, calls the LLM, and stores the answer.\n",
    "4.  Build the `StateGraph`, add the nodes, and define the edges (`RETRIEVE` -> `GENERATE`).\n",
    "5.  Compile the graph and invoke it with a question about your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Quality:** A functional graph that can answer a simple question (e.g., \"What is the purpose of this project?\") by retrieving context from the project artifacts."

    "**Task:** Build a sophisticated \"research team\" of specialized agents that includes a router to delegate tasks to the correct specialist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  **Specialize your retriever:** Create two separate retrievers. One for the PRD (`prd_retriever`) and one for the technical documents (`tech_retriever` for schema and ADRs).\n",
    "2.  **Define the Agents:**\n",
    "    * `ProjectManagerAgent`: This will be the entry point and will act as a router. It uses an LLM to decide whether the user's question is about product requirements or technical details, and routes to the appropriate researcher.\n",
    "    * `PRDResearcherAgent`: A node that uses the `prd_retriever`.\n",
    "    * `TechResearcherAgent`: A node that uses the `tech_retriever`.\n",
    "    * `SynthesizerAgent`: A node that takes the collected documents from either researcher and synthesizes a final answer.\n",
    "3.  **Build the Graph:** Use conditional edges to orchestrate the flow: The entry point is the `ProjectManager`, which then routes to either the `PRD_RESEARCHER` or `TECH_RESEARCHER`. Both of those nodes should then route to the `SYNTHESIZE` node, which then goes to the `END`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Quality:** A highly advanced agentic system that mimics a real-world research workflow, including a router and specialist roles, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the RAG process."

      "*   **Key Performance Indicator (KPI):** Time (in days) to complete the first \"Quick Win\" task.\n",
      "*   **Target:** Decrease the average time by 25% within six months post-launch.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Enhance the New Hire Experience\n",
      "The goal is to create a consistently positive and welcoming onboarding process for all new employees, regardless of their department. This addresses the pain point of the HR Coordinator, Sarah, who worries about ad-hoc and inconsistent experiences.\n",
      "*   **Key Performance Indicator (KPI):** New Hire Satisfaction Score (measured via an NPS-style survey at 30 days).\n",
      "*   **Target:** Achieve a score of +50 or higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Increase Operational Efficiency\n",

      "### 4. Improve Company Compliance\n",
      "A critical goal is to ensure that all new hires complete mandatory training and paperwork in a timely manner. This directly addresses the HR Coordinator's challenge of having \"no centralized way to ensure mandatory compliance training is completed on time.\" The future development of a \"Compliance tracking dashboard\" further supports this objective.\n",
      "*   **Key Performance Indicator (KPI):** On-time completion rate for mandatory tasks (e.g., Security Training).\n",

      "Documents found: 4\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "Based on the technical documents provided, here is a comprehensive answer regarding the selected database technology and the reasons for its selection.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Selected Database Technology\n",
      "\n",
      "The selected database technology is **PostgreSQL, enhanced with a vector extension** (such as `pgvector`).\n",
      "\n",
      "This solution allows the team to store and query vector embeddings directly within their existing relational database, rather than introducing a separate, specialized vector database.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Rationale for Selection\n",
      "\n",
      "The decision to use a vector-enabled PostgreSQL was driven by a strategic focus on architectural simplicity, operational efficiency, and data integrity, especially given the constraints of a small engineering team. The key reasons are detailed below:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Architectural Simplicity and Operational Efficiency**\n",
      "\n",
      "A primary driver for this choice was to minimize system complexity and operational overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Unified Data Store:** It allows the team to maintain a single database for both standard relational data (e.g., user metadata, department, creation dates) and the vector embeddings required for semantic search. This avoids the complexity of managing two separate database systems.\n",
      "*   **Reduced Operational Burden:** By building on their existing PostgreSQL infrastructure, the team avoids the significant overhead associated with deploying, monitoring, backing up, and securing a new, specialized database. This was a critical advantage for a small team, as it allows them to leverage their current expertise and tools, eliminating the learning curve and maintenance costs of a new technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Guaranteed Data Integrity and Consistency**\n",
      "\n",
      "The co-location of vectors and their corresponding metadata within a single, transaction-safe environment was a crucial factor in meeting the high data integrity requirements of the B2B platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **ACID Compliance:** Storing vectors and metadata together ensures that all updates are atomic and ACID-compliant. This completely eliminates an entire class of data synchronization problems that can occur when trying to keep two separate databases (one relational, one vector) in sync.\n",
      "*   **Transactional Safety:** Data remains consistent because changes to metadata and their associated vectors happen within the same transaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Powerful and Flexible Hybrid Search Capabilities**\n",
      "\n",
      "The solution was chosen to directly enable the core product driver: implementing a powerful hybrid search feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Atomic Hybrid Queries:** This architecture enables powerful, single-query hybrid searches that combine semantic (vector) search with traditional metadata filtering.\n",
      "*   **Seamless Integration:** Users can execute complex queries that filter results based on specific criteria before or after the semantic search is performed. For example, a single SQL query can find documents semantically similar to *\"time off policy\"* while simultaneously filtering for those belonging to the *\"Engineering\"* department and created in the last year, all in one efficient operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Leverage of a Mature and Reliable Ecosystem**\n",
      "\n",
      "By choosing PostgreSQL, the team benefits from a battle-tested and robust platform. This directly addresses the constraint that the solution must be highly reliable. The mature ecosystem provides extensive, well-established tools and community support for backups, high availability, security, and performance tuning.\n",

    "\n",
    "Incredible work! You have now built a truly sophisticated AI system. You've learned how to create a knowledge base for an agent and how to use LangGraph to orchestrate a team of specialized agents to solve a complex problem. You progressed from a simple RAG chain to a system that includes quality checks (the Grader) and intelligent task delegation (the Router). These are the core patterns for building production-ready RAG applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Takeaway:** LangGraph allows you to define complex, stateful, multi-agent workflows as a graph. Using nodes for agents and conditional edges for decision-making enables the creation of sophisticated systems that can reason, delegate, and collaborate to solve problems more effectively than a single agent could alone."
