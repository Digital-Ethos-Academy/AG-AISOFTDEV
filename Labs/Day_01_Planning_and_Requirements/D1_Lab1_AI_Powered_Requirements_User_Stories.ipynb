    "# Day 1 - Lab 1: AI-Powered Requirements & User Stories\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Use a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose a vague problem statement into structured features, user personas, and Agile user stories, culminating in a machine-readable JSON artifact.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 90 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "Welcome to the first hands-on lab of the AI-Driven Software Engineering Program! All great software projects begin with a clear understanding of the problem to be solved. In this lab, you will take on the role of a tech lead or product manager and use an LLM as a co-pilot to transform a simple, high-level problem into a set of well-defined, actionable requirements. This process is fundamental to ensuring that the team builds the *right* product.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Model Selection:**\n",
    "Our `utils.py` script is configured to work with multiple AI providers. You can change the `model_name` parameter in the `setup_llm_client()` function to any of the models listed in the `RECOMMENDED_MODELS` dictionary in `utils.py`. For example, to use a Hugging Face model, you could change the line to: `client, model_name, api_provider = setup_llm_client(model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Helper Functions Used:**\n",

    "- `get_completion()`: To send a prompt to the LLM and get a response.\n",

      "    *   **Unclear Expectations:** Not having a clear roadmap for her first 30, 60, and 90 days.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Task:** Now for the highest-value step. Instead of just looking at the JSON, we will programmatically validate it and save it as a formal project artifact. This ensures reliability and prepares the requirements for automated use in later stages of the SDLC.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1. Complete the `validate_and_save_stories` function below.\n",
    "2. The function should iterate through the list of stories.\n",
    "3. For each story, it must validate that the required keys are present and that the acceptance criteria list is not empty.\n",
    "4. If all stories are valid, it should save the data to `artifacts/day1_user_stories.json`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Quality:** A robust script that guarantees the integrity of our requirements artifact. The final output is a validated `day1_user_stories.json` file in the `artifacts` directory, ready to be used as a reliable input for Day 2."

    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have completed the first lab. You started with a vague, one-sentence problem and finished with a structured, validated, machine-readable requirements artifact. This is the critical first step in an AI-assisted software development lifecycle. The `day1_user_stories.json` file you created will be the direct input for our next lab, where we will generate a formal Product Requirements Document (PRD).\n",

    "> **Key Takeaway:** The single most important skill demonstrated in this lab is turning unstructured ideas into structured, machine-readable data (JSON). This transformation is what enables automation and integration with other tools later in the SDLC."
