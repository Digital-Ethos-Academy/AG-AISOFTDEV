      "Companies struggle to provide a consistent, engaging, and efficient onboarding experience for new employees. This leads to new hire anxiety and confusion, significant administrative overhead for managers and HR, and potential compliance risks. Without a structured process, new hires take longer to become productive, and their long-term engagement and retention can be negatively impacted.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1.2 Vision & Goals\n",
      "Our vision is to create a seamless, engaging, and scalable onboarding experience that empowers new hires to feel welcome and productive from day one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary goals of this platform are to:\n",
      "*   **Improve New Hire Satisfaction:** Reduce first-day anxiety and provide clarity and support throughout the initial months.\n",
      "*   **Accelerate Time-to-Productivity:** Equip new hires with the resources, connections, and clear expectations they need to contribute meaningfully, faster.\n",
      "*   **Streamline Administrative Overhead:** Automate repetitive tasks and provide templates and tools for HR and hiring managers to save time and effort.\n",
      "*   **Ensure Compliance & Consistency:** Standardize the onboarding process to ensure all new hires complete necessary training and paperwork, mitigating company risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1.3 Scope\n",
      "This document outlines the requirements for the initial release (v1.0) of the Employee Onboarding Platform. The scope includes core functionalities for HR administration (template creation, analytics), the manager's experience (planning, tracking), and the new hire's journey from pre-boarding through their first 90 days.\n",

      "*   **Goals:** Create a world-class, consistent onboarding experience for all employees. Ensure company-wide compliance. Measure and improve the effectiveness of the onboarding program using data.\n",
      "*   **Pain Points:** Onboarding is currently ad-hoc and varies by department. It's difficult to track whether new hires have completed mandatory compliance training. Manually collecting feedback is time-consuming and yields low response rates.\n",

For sections NOT directly covered in the user stories (such as \"Goals & Success Metrics\", \"Non-Functional Requirements\", \"Out of Scope\", etc.), use your expertise to infer and create logical, realistic content based on:\n   - The overall goal of streamlining new hire onboarding\n   - Common industry best practices for onboarding systems\n   - Typical enterprise software requirements\n5. Ensure the Executive Summary captures the essence of the entire product vision.\n6. In the \"Goals & Success Metrics\" section, create a realistic table with specific KPIs and measurable targets.\n7. For \"Out of Scope\", identify features that would be valuable but are intentionally excluded from the initial release.\n8. Replace all placeholder text (e.g., [Product Name], [Your Name], [Date]) with appropriate values.\n9. Maintain a professional, clear, and actionable tone throughout.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Your response must be valid markdown format\n- Follow the exact section structure and numbering from the template\n- Be thorough and comprehensive - this is a formal document for stakeholders\n- Ensure consistency in terminology and formatting throughout\n\nGenerate the complete PRD now.\"\"\"\n\nprint(\"--- Generating PRD from Template ---\")\nif user_stories_data and prd_template_content:\n    prd_from_template_output = get_completion(template_prd_prompt, client, model_name, api_provider)\n    print(prd_from_template_output)\nelse:\n    print(\"Skipping PRD generation because user stories or template are missing.\")\n    prd_from_template_output = \"\"",

      "## 1. Executive Summary & Vision\n",
      "Momentum is an integrated onboarding platform designed to streamline and standardize the new hire experience. We are building Momentum to solve the widespread problem of inconsistent, manual, and overwhelming onboarding processes that lead to decreased new hire productivity, increased administrative burden, and lower employee engagement. Our vision is to create a single source of truth for onboarding that empowers HR, equips managers, and excites new hires, ultimately accelerating time-to-contribution and fostering a stronger sense of belonging from day one.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. The Problem\n",
      "**2.1. Problem Statement:**\n",
      "New hires currently face a fragmented and inefficient onboarding experience, characterized by scattered information, manual paperwork, and a lack of clarity on expectations. This results in first-day anxiety, a high volume of repetitive questions for managers and HR, and a delayed ramp-up to full productivity. Concurrently, hiring managers and HR administrators lack the tools to easily create, assign, and track onboarding plans, leading to inconsistent experiences across the company and an inability to measure the program's effectiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2.2. User Personas & Scenarios:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Persona 1: Amelia, the Ambitious Achiever (The New Hire)**\n",
      "  *Amelia has just accepted a job offer. She is excited but anxious. She receives multiple emails from HR, IT, and her new manager with different forms to sign and articles to read. She isn't sure what's most important, who to ask for help, or what her first week will even look like, causing her to feel overwhelmed before she even starts.*\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Persona 2: David, the Dedicated Director (The Hiring Manager)**\n",
      "  *David has a new team member starting in two weeks. He needs to prepare their first-week schedule, assign a buddy, define initial goals, and ensure their equipment is ready. He searches his drive for the old onboarding checklist he used last time, manually updates it, and emails it out, hoping he hasn't forgotten any critical steps. He has no easy way to see if the new hire has completed their pre-boarding paperwork.*\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Persona 3: Sarah, the Strategic Systemizer (The HR Coordinator)**\n",
      "  *Sarah is responsible for the company's overall onboarding program. She worries that some departments provide a world-class experience while others are ad-hoc. She has no centralized way to ensure mandatory compliance training is completed on time and struggles to collect meaningful feedback to justify improvements to the program.*\n",

      "| Enhance the New Hire Experience | New Hire Satisfaction Score (NPS-style survey at 30 days) | Achieve a score of +50 or higher. |\n",
      "| Increase Operational Efficiency | Time spent by managers and HR creating/managing onboarding plans | Reduce by 40% based on qualitative surveys. |\n",
      "| Improve Company Compliance | On-time completion rate for mandatory tasks (e.g., Security Training) | Achieve 100% completion within the first 30 days for all new hires. |\n",
