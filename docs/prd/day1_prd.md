# Product Requirements Document: Momentum Onboarding Platform

| Status | **Draft** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Author** | Senior Product Manager |
| **Version** | 1.0 |
| **Last Updated** | October 28, 2025 |

## 1. Executive Summary & Vision
Momentum is an integrated onboarding platform designed to streamline and standardize the new hire experience. We are building Momentum to solve the widespread problem of inconsistent, manual, and overwhelming onboarding processes that lead to decreased new hire productivity, increased administrative burden, and lower employee engagement. Our vision is to create a single source of truth for onboarding that empowers HR, equips managers, and excites new hires, ultimately accelerating time-to-contribution and fostering a stronger sense of belonging from day one.

## 2. The Problem
**2.1. Problem Statement:**
New hires currently face a fragmented and inefficient onboarding experience, characterized by scattered information, manual paperwork, and a lack of clarity on expectations. This results in first-day anxiety, a high volume of repetitive questions for managers and HR, and a delayed ramp-up to full productivity. Concurrently, hiring managers and HR administrators lack the tools to easily create, assign, and track onboarding plans, leading to inconsistent experiences across the company and an inability to measure the program's effectiveness.

**2.2. User Personas & Scenarios:**

- **Persona 1: Amelia, the Ambitious Achiever (The New Hire)**
  *Amelia has just accepted a job offer. She is excited but anxious. She receives multiple emails from HR, IT, and her new manager with different forms to sign and articles to read. She isn't sure what's most important, who to ask for help, or what her first week will even look like, causing her to feel overwhelmed before she even starts.*

- **Persona 2: David, the Dedicated Director (The Hiring Manager)**
  *David has a new team member starting in two weeks. He needs to prepare their first-week schedule, assign a buddy, define initial goals, and ensure their equipment is ready. He searches his drive for the old onboarding checklist he used last time, manually updates it, and emails it out, hoping he hasn't forgotten any critical steps. He has no easy way to see if the new hire has completed their pre-boarding paperwork.*

- **Persona 3: Sarah, the Strategic Systemizer (The HR Coordinator)**
  *Sarah is responsible for the company's overall onboarding program. She worries that some departments provide a world-class experience while others are ad-hoc. She has no centralized way to ensure mandatory compliance training is completed on time and struggles to collect meaningful feedback to justify improvements to the program.*

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics
*How will we measure success? This section defines the specific, measurable outcomes we expect.*

| Goal | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) | Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Accelerate New Hire Time-to-Productivity | Time (in days) to complete first "Quick Win" task | Decrease average by 25% within 6 months post-launch. |
| Enhance the New Hire Experience | New Hire Satisfaction Score (NPS-style survey at 30 days) | Achieve a score of +50 or higher. |
| Increase Operational Efficiency | Time spent by managers and HR creating/managing onboarding plans | Reduce by 40% based on qualitative surveys. |
| Improve Company Compliance | On-time completion rate for mandatory tasks (e.g., Security Training) | Achieve 100% completion within the first 30 days for all new hires. |

## 4. Functional Requirements & User Stories

All Personally Identifiable Information (PII) must be encrypted both in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256).

## 7. Out of Scope & Future Considerations
*Defining boundaries is critical for a successful and timely launch.*

**7.1. Out of Scope for V1.0:**
- **Direct integration with third-party HRIS/Payroll systems:** Data will be managed via CSV import/export initially.

- **Calendar Integration:** The schedule will be displayed in-app but will not automatically sync to user's Outlook/Google calendars in V1.0.

**7.2. Future Work:**
- **Integration with the corporate Learning Management System (LMS):** To assign and track formal training courses.
- **AI-powered onboarding journeys:** Suggesting relevant resources or connections based on a new hire's role and background.
- **Deeper HRIS integration:** For automatic creation of new hire profiles and data synchronization.
- **Social features:** Such as new hire cohort discussion groups or forums.

## 8. Appendix & Open Questions

- **Open Question:** Who will be responsible for creating and maintaining the content for role-specific playbooks (e.g., Engineering vs. Sales)?
- **Open Question:** What is the defined process for providing login credentials to new hires after an offer is accepted?
- **Dependency:** Final UI/UX design mockups are required from the Design team by Nov 15, 2025, to inform sprint planning.
- **Dependency:** Collaboration with the IT Security team is required to configure SSO integration by Dec 1, 2025.
- **Assumption:** The company has a standardized set of digital HR and tax forms that can be used for the e-signature process.
